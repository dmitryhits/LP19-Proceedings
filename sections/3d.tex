\section{3D Pixel Detectors}
By placing column-like electrodes inside the detector material, the 3D geometry reduces the drift distance of a charge created by ionising particles compared to a planar device. More details about the working principle can be found in \cite{parker}, \cite{3D}. All devices discussed in this article were constructed with \ac{pCVD} diamond.
