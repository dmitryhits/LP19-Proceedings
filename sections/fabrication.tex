\subsection{Fabrication}
All devices discussed in this article were constructed with \ac{pCVD} diamond. The sensors are thin panes with a thickness of \orderof{\SI{500}{\um}} and a side length of \orderof{\SI{500}{\mm}}. In order to manufacture the electrodes in diamond, columns were fabricated through the thin side using a \SI{130}{\femto\second} laser with a wavelength of \SI{800}{\nano\meter} which converts the diamond into a electrically resistive mixture of different carbon phases \cite{3dfab}. A \ac{SLM} was used to correct spherical aberrations during fabrication to achieve a column yield of $\gtrsim$\SI{ 99.8}{\%}, a column diameter of \SI{2.6}{\micro\meter} and a resistivity of the columns of the order of \SIrange{.1}{1}{\ohm\cm} \cite{slm}. The columns are not drilled completely through the diamond, but with a gap of \SI{15}{\micro\meter} to the opposite surface to avoid high voltage breakthrough at the operated voltages of up to \SI{\sim 2}{\volt/\um}. The detector was constructed by ganging all bias columns together with a metallisation on the bottom surface and metallise the single readout columns on the top surface in order to bump bond the sensor to the readout electronics.\par
The detectors described herein were connected to two different \acp{ROC}, which is why different bonding processes, as shown in Figures \ref{fig:bb}, had to be used. For both of these detectors a 3D cell size of \SI{50x50}{\micro\meter} was chosen. Since the layout of the \acp{ROC} had a different pixel pitch several cells were ganged together by connecting several readout columns with the surface metallisation. The detector B6 was connected to the PSI46digV2.1respin \ac{ROC} \cite{kornmayer} with a \SI{3x2}{} cell ganging to match the pixel pitch of \SI{150x100}{\micro\meter}. It was bump bonded to the \ac{ROC} at the Nanofabrication Lab at the Princeton University with indium. This was achieved by putting equal height indium columns on both \ac{ROC} and the sensor and then pressing them together \ref{fig:bbc}. The detector B5 was connected to the FE-I4B \ac{ROC} \cite{fei4} with a \SI{5x1}{} cell ganging due to the pixel pitch of \SI{250x50}{\micro\meter}. The bump bonding for this sensor was performed at IFAE-CNM in Barcelona by an adapted process with tin-silver bumps \ref{fig:bba}.\par

Both devices have \SI{\sim 4000}{} 3D cells, where one cell consists of four bias electrodes and one readout electrode in the centre. Since the bias electrodes are shared between the cells, \SI{\sim 7000}{columns} had to be drilled to build such a device.
Photographs of the assembled 3D detectors on the \acp{ROC} are shown in Figure \vref{fig:3d}.
