% As nuclear and high energy facilities around the world strive for higher and higher energies and intensities, more radiation tolerant technologies are required to withstand the increasing radiation doses.
% The development of extremely radiation tolerant tracking devices has become a very hot topic as the expected radiation doses of future nuclear and high energy facilities become quantified. 
As a possible candidate for extremely radiation tolerant tracking devices  we present a novel detector design - namely 3D detectors - based on poly-crystalline CVD diamond sensors with a pixel readout. The fabrication of recent 3D detectors as well their results in recent beam tests are presented. We measured the hit efficiency and signal response of two 3D diamond detectors with $50\times50\,\upmu$m cell sizes using pixel readout chip technologies currently used at CMS and ATLAS. In all runs, both devices attained efficiencies  >98\,\% in a normal incident test beam of minimum ionising particles. The highest efficiency observed during the beam tests was 99.2\,\%.
