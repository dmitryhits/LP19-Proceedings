As nuclear and high energy facilities around the world strive for higher and higher energies and intensities, more radiation tolerant technologies are required to withstand the increasing radiation doses. Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) diamond is an excellent candidate for this purpose. Detectors out of this material are already established in the highest irradiation regimes for the beam condition monitors at the LHC. The RD42 collaboration is leading an effort to use CVD diamonds also as sensor material for the future tracking detectors. We present a novel detector design - namely 3D Detectors - based on poly-crystalline CVD diamond sensors with a pixel readout. The fabrication of these 3D detectors as well as their working principle is shown. We measured the efficiency and signal response of two 3D diamond detectors with $50\times50\,\upmu$m cell sizes using readout chip technologies currently used at CMS and ATLAS.
