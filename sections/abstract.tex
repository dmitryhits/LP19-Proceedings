As nuclear and high energy facilities around the world strive for higher and higher energies and intensities, more radiation tolerant technologies are required to withstand the increasing radiation doses.
As a possible candidate we present a novel detector design - namely 3D Detectors - based on poly-crystalline CVD diamond sensors with a pixel readout. The fabrication of these 3D detectors as well the results of the most recent detectors are show. We measured the efficiency and signal response of two 3D diamond detectors with $50\times50\,\upmu$m cell sizes using pixel readout chip technologies currently used at CMS and ATLAS. The maximum measured efficiency was 99.2\,\%.
