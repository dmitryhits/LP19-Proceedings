As nuclear and high energy facilities around the world strive for higher and higher energies and intensities, more radiation tolerant technologies are required to withstand the increasing radiation doses.
As a possible candidate we present a novel detector design - namely 3D Detectors - based on poly-crystalline CVD diamond sensors with a pixel readout. The fabrication of these 3D detectors as well as their working principle is shown. We measured the efficiency and signal response of two 3D diamond detectors with $50\times50\,\upmu$m cell sizes using readout chip technologies currently used at CMS and ATLAS.
