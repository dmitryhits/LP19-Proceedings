\section{Conclusion}
We demonstrated a progress in the development of radiation tolerant particle detectors based on \ac{pCVD} diamond. The preliminary results show two working prototypes of 3D diamond pixel detectors with a cell size of \SI{50x50}{\um} and a column diameters of \SI{2.6}{\um}. The devices had a total number of \SI{3551}{cells} and the efficiency of the column drilling process is above \SI{99.8}{\%}. The first prototypes of small cell 3D diamond pixel detectors read out more charge than any planar \ac{pCVD} diamond detector. At normal incidence the measured relative hit efficiency of the 3D pixel detectors reached a maximum of \SI{99.2}{\%} compared to a planar silicon device. One device shows a slightly lower efficiency of \SI{98.2}{\%}.\par
Future test are planned in order to solve the open questions. Tests at non-normal incidence will hopefully show the origin of the missing \SI{.8}{\%} in efficiency compared to planar silicon. Further investigations of detector 2 will show whether the lower efficiency is due to the bump bonding or electrostatic issues or something else.
