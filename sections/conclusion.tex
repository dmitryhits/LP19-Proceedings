\section{Conclusion}
There is progress in the development of radiation tolerant particle detectors based on \ac{pCVD} diamonds. The working principle of 3D diamond pixel detectors was proven for cell sizes of \SI{50x50}{\micro\meter} and column diameters of \SI{2.6}{\micro\meter}. The largest device had a number of \SI{4000}{cells} and the efficiency of the column drilling process is above \SI{99.8}{\%}. The first prototypes of small cell 3D diamond pixel detectors read out more charge than any planar \ac{pCVD} diamond detector. The measured relative hit efficiency of the 3D pixel detectors reached \SI{99.2}{\%} compared to a planar silicon device.\par
