\section{Conclusion}
We demonstrated a progress in the development of radiation tolerant particle detectors based on \ac{pCVD} diamonds. We showed two working prototypes of 3D diamond pixel detectors with sizes of \SI{50x50}{\um} and column diameters of \SI{2.6}{\um}. The shown devices had a total number of \SI{3551}{cells} and the efficiency of the column drilling process is above \SI{99.8}{\%}. The first prototypes of small cell 3D diamond pixel detectors read out more charge than any planar \ac{pCVD} diamond detector. The measured relative hit efficiency of the 3D pixel detectors reached a maximum of \SI{99.2}{\%} compared to a planar silicon device.\par
